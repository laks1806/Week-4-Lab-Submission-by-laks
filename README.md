#Below is the question
Flood Fill Function Flood-fill is a common algorithm used to fill connected regions of the board with a new value based on a specified condition. The code takes an input board, an old value, a new value, and coordinates (x, y) as arguments. It recursively updates the board by changing the old value to the new value for all connected cells.  
For the code itself, please implement the flood fill function, which builds on the concepts of functions and recursions discussed in Week 3.

#Input
board = 
    "......................",
    "......##########......",
    "......#........#......",
    "......#........#......",
    "......#........#####..",
    "....###............#..",
    "....#............###..",
    "....##############....",


#Output
# ......................
# ......##########......
# ......#~~~~~~~~#......
# ......#~~~~~~~~#......
# ......#~~~~~~~~#####..
# ....###~~~~~~~~~~~~#..
# ....#~~~~~~~~~~~~###..
# ....##############....
